## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE:
 * Georgia Institute of Technology:
  - Theoretical investigation of semiconducting character of organic segregated- and mixed-stack charge transfer complexes: single molecule, cluster and periodic boundary calculations. 
  - Use of both ab initio and model Hamiltonians to understand ground and excited state properties of highly correlated organic materials, with applications in electronics and superconductivity.
  - Evaluating significance of lattice vibrations and electron-phonon coupling in charge transport of crystals of conjugated small organic molecules.
 * New Mexico Highlands University:
  - Single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies of organic, organometallic compounds, and metal-organic frameworks. 
  - High resolution XRD investigates yielding experimental charge-density distribution of organic and organometallic compounds.
  - Structural studies of crystal packing motifs of compounds for organic electronics.
