# VASP implementation
Currently, phonons can be obtained in a straightforward way only at Î“-point (there are other, *less* straight ways, to access phonons at different k-points)[1].

## vasprun.xml
As the result of a phonon calculation (```IBRION = 5/6/7/8```), ```vasprun.xml``` will contain hessian matrix.
