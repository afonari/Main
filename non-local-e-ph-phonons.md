## Nonlocal electron-phonon coupling
Nonlocal el-ph coupling results from the interaction of the charge with lattice vibration (phonon). As decribed in literature [1] el-ph coupling can be related to the changes in couplings of the frontier orbitals of neighbouring molecules due to changes in geometry of the molecules. In particular, coupling constant that depends on the derivative of the transfer integral over normal mode displacement can be defined:

where, Qm is dimensionless displacement, and thus *Gi* has units of energy.
